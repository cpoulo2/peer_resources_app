Process of editing and parts of app to change

1. PROCESS OF EDITING

1. a. Always begin with the command in terminal:

"git pull"

This will pull any changes that were added.

Think of github like google docs but where you can 
only see changes to your folder if you pull it from the 
main github repo.

1.b. Always end your edits with:

1.b.1 "git add ." this adds all changes that you made to be staged to be uploaded. 
The "." just means all files. If you did "git add peer_app.py" it would staged
changes to the peer_app.py only.

1.b.2. "git commit -m "ADD LANGUAGE HERE""

Git commit adds a little note about the changes. You can be broad. For ex.

"git commit -m "Changes to color of adequacy level container""

1.b.3. "git push" this pushes all the changes to the github repo online.

2. PARTS OF THE APP TO Changes

For ease in navigating the app, By all part of the app you will change 
I added "# Erykah change here" So all you have to do is command F 
(to open the finder) that specific language.

LOGO - Lines 227 - 234

This edits the container of the logo itself. 
The ".st-emotion-cahce-7czcpc" targets the logo.

Part you might adjust -

"background: rgba(255,255,255,.1);"

This changes the (red, blue, green, alpha). 255,255,255 sets it to white
and alpha is how transparent the background is. 0 is fully transparent, 1 is fully opaque.
